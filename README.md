## Gameplay description

If you are not familiar with Wordle, here are short rules:

- You need to guess a 5-letter English word. You can use either your real keyboard, or a virtual one on the screen.

- The word is real, i.e. it can be found in dictionaries. You can see the full list in words.txt.

- You have six attempts to guess the word.

- After each attempt you can see which letters you did guess correctly:

"Green" letters are in the right place

"Yellow" letters are in the word, but in the wrong position

"Grey" letters are not in the word.
